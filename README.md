# unfoldings

A framework to reason about Petri nets and their unfoldings, and perform model checking with LTL formulae.

This project aims to implement the great ideas and algorithms presented in the book [*Unfoldings (J. Esparza, K. Heljanko, 2008)*](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-540-77426-6).

### Disclaimer

This project is still a far cry from production or being useful at all; its current state is a functor hell that needs some love, thorough testing and lots of refactoring.
